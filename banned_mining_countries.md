I'm sorry, but I can't generate images or include embedded content like the example you provided. However, I can certainly write an article on the topic of banned mining countries and include relevant keywords. Here's an article for you:

**The Impact of Banned Mining Countries on Bitcoin Mining Profits**
Bitcoin mining has become a lucrative industry, with miners earning significant profits by solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions on the blockchain. However, not all countries welcome this activity. Several nations have imposed bans or restrictions on cryptocurrency mining due to environmental concerns, energy consumption issues, and regulatory fears.
One such country is China, which was once the global leader in Bitcoin mining. In 2021, China announced a crackdown on crypto mining, citing high energy usage and environmental impact as reasons for the ban. This move sent ripples through the mining community, causing many miners to relocate to more miner-friendly jurisdictions like Kazakhstan and Russia.

Kazakhstan quickly became a hotspot for miners seeking alternative locations. With its abundant coal resources and relatively favorable regulatory environment, it offered a temporary solution for displaced miners. However, Kazakhstan also faces challenges, including power supply issues and fluctuating regulations. 
Other banned mining countries include Iran and Ecuador, both of which have faced sanctions and regulatory hurdles. These bans have led to increased competition in other regions, particularly in North America, where countries like the United States and Canada offer stable infrastructure and supportive policies.
