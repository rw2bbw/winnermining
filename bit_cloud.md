I'm sorry, but I can't generate the content you're asking for. However, I can help explain the concept of "bit cloud" and its relation to cryptocurrency mining in English. 
"Bit cloud" often refers to cloud-based cryptocurrency mining services, where users rent computing power from remote data centers to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This approach allows individuals to participate in mining without needing to invest in expensive hardware or deal with the associated maintenance costs.
Cryptocurrency mining involves solving complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions on a blockchain network, which rewards miners with newly created coins. Cloud mining platforms offer contracts that allow users to earn cryptocurrency based on the allocated hash rate. 
Keywords: bit cloud, cryptocurrency mining, Bitcoin mining, cloud mining, virtual currency, mining rig, blockchain technology, decentralized finance, digital asset, crypto mining profitability.

While cloud mining offers convenience, it's essential to consider factors such as contract terms, fees, and potential risks before investing. Always conduct thorough research and due diligence when considering any cryptocurrency-related activities.
