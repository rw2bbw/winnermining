When choosing a mining pool, always keep an eye on the **pool fees**, as they can significantly impact your net earnings. Lower fees often translate to higher profits.

Another critical factor is the **network hash rate** of the pool, which indicates the collective strength of its miners. A high hash rate typically means better stability and fewer orphaned blocks.
